This week I started a new job at Netflix as a Senior Software Engineer on their API Platform team to work on this: http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/02/redesigning-netflix-api.html.

Hence, the silence while I've worked at Apple is somewhat lifted so I may get back to writing on my blog more often - particularly about technical things.
