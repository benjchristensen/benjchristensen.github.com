Netbeans (which I never use) has seemingly come a long way since I last looked at it. The UI is certainly a lot nicer.

Today however, it's the [Heap Profiler](http://www.netbeans.org/features/java/profiler.html) that I'm happy with - cause it actually works unlike anything else I've tried today.

It loaded a 3.5GB  heap in less than 30 seconds! (I had set my max heap for Netbeans to 12GB on my 16GB, 8-core machine).

Finally a tool for heap analysis that works and works well. And it's elegant looking at the same time.
