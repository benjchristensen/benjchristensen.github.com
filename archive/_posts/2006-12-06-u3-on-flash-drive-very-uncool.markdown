I agree with this post [http://www.mischel.com/diary/2006/06/23.htm](http://www.mischel.com/diary/2006/06/23.htm)  
  
Why does a flash drive come with a permanent CD-ROM partition on it that can't be removed by formatting and that mounts every time I put it in?  
  
Very wrong. Very.  
  
... a little later while trying to remove the stupid thing ... it's even worse ... the only uninstaller available is for Windows only! Freak! (http://www.u3.com/uninstall/) I really don't like this company.
