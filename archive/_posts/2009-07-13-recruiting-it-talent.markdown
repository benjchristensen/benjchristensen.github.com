An interesting [article](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2009/07/recruiting-elite-it-talent.html) by James McGovern on recruiting IT talent.

The gist of it is that it's very difficult to rely upon resumes, and that we as an industry seem to put up with "falsification" of skills and keep people onboard who really don't have the skills they need to do their job.

It closes with the following statement:


<blockquote>"World class organizations are built on foundations where people can trust each other and don't have to second guess the ability of the team. If you find yourself in a shop that doesn't get it and you stay, maybe you are getting exactly what you deserve... " - James McGovern</blockquote>
