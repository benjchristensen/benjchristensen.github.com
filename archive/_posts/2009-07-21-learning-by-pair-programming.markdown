Last week I learned how to program on the iPhone using Objective-C and Cocoa Touch by having two 2-hour pair programming sessions with [Brent Coursey](http://twitter.com/coursey) and about 8 hours of my own playing around.

I am comfortable now with XCode, Interface Building and Objective-C - enough that I can build code to do what I want it to do, compile, run, debug, test and install on my personal iPhone.

I've connected to web services via Objective-C and built a user interface to interact with the services.

All in all it was a good experience and great way to learn - and the pair programming was very useful in speeding up the learning process. Unlike 10 years ago where I plenty of time to learn through trial and error, it was much more effective to sit and watch someone and see how everything worked together. I was able to pick it up very quickly that way.

Of course, 10+ years of object oriented programming in Java translates over well to the thinking and expectations - but the syntax and different ways of doing things were far from natural for a java programmer (especially one who had respectfully ignored the C way of doing things), so the demonstration received through pairing was immediately beneficial. (On second thought, ignoring C probably helped since I saw Objective-C as an OO language from the start - not as C)

A 2 hour session with Kent Beck [sold on EBay for $405](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180375524276). That would be quite the experience - would love to do that and see how he or someone else at his level does their craft.
