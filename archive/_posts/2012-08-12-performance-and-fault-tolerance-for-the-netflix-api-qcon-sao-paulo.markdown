A presentation I gave at QCon Sao Paulo on August 4th 2012 (http://qconsp.com/palestrante/ben-christensen)

**Presentation Description**

The Netflix API receives over a billion requests a day which translates into multiple billions of calls to underlying systems in the Netflix service-oriented architecture. These requests come from more than 800 different devices ranging from gaming consoles like the PS3, XBox and Wii to set-top boxes, TVs and mobile devices such as Android and iOS.

This presentation describes how the Netflix API supports those devices and achieves fault tolerance in a distributed architecture while depending on dozens of systems which can fail at any time. It also explains how a new system design allows each device to optimize API calls to their unique needs and leverage concurrency on the server-side to improve their performance.

(Some slides have been modified and notes included for readability and understanding of content without accompanying speech.)
