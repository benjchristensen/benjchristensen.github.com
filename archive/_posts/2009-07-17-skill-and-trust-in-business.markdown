Dictionary.com defines [skill](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skill) as:



	
  * the ability, coming from one's knowledge, practice, aptitude, etc., to do something well

	
  * competent excellence in performance; expertness;


[Trust](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trust) is defined as:



	
  * reliance on the integrity, strength, ability, surety, etc., of a person or thing; confidence.


Two common themes are [ability](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ability) defined as:



	
  * competence in an activity or occupation because of one's skill, training, or other qualification

	
  * power or capacity to do or act physically, mentally, legally, morally, financially, etc.


My experience unfortunately is that skill and ability in people are not abundant - and therefore it is hard to have trust.

More problems are caused by lack of skill than anything else I run into.

Making mistakes and learning from them is part of life - it's the human experience.

However, there is a reason world class organizations have "senior" people  and restrict the impact of "junior" people's mistakes by limiting what they are allowed to do and affect until they have gained trust - by demonstrating their ability and skill.

Trust nowadays is given away much too freely - desire, eagerness, willingness do not replace ability and skill.

Trust should not be given unless someone has earned it. People should not expect to be trusted until they've earned it by showing they deserve it.

I had someone tell me (after failing on something) that I should trust them more and give them "opportunity" so they could succeed (by giving them the 'keys to the kingdom'). This is backwards. Prove to me on small things incrementally and trust will be earned and greater opportunities given.

Trust does not work like "innocent until proven guilty". Trust must be earned. Trust stems from skill, honesty, aptitude, competence and most importantly - time.

If business operations are failing, my opinion is it's generally due to placing trust and unfair expectations on people who do not have the skill or ability to deliver.

Put the money and time on having the right people - and restrict the impact of "junior" people - and operations will improve.
