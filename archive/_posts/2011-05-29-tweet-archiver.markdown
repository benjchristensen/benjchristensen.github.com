I wanted to learn Ruby so wrote a script to do something I've wanted for a while - a simple mechanism to retrieve all of my Tweets using the Twitter API.

Eventually I'll add the functionality I want that will expand all shortened links and perhaps even download pictures that I've linked to or posted via services such as TwitPic.

Anyway, Ruby is kind of perfect for this type of hacking it seems and now I can archive my Twitter history easily (and yes I know there are lots of other people who have done this before ... don't bother telling me, I just needed something more than "Hello World").
