  <h1 class="post-title">Learning by Pair Programming</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2009</span>
  <p>Last week I learned how to program on the iPhone using Objective-C and Cocoa Touch by having two 2-hour pair programming sessions with <a href="http://twitter.com/coursey">Brent Coursey</a> and about 8 hours of my own playing around.</p>

<p>I am comfortable now with XCode, Interface Building and Objective-C - enough that I can build code to do what I want it to do, compile, run, debug, test and install on my personal iPhone.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve connected to web services via Objective-C and built a user interface to interact with the services.</p>

<p>All in all it was a good experience and great way to learn - and the pair programming was very useful in speeding up the learning process. Unlike 10 years ago where I plenty of time to learn through trial and error, it was much more effective to sit and watch someone and see how everything worked together. I was able to pick it up very quickly that way.</p>

<p>Of course, 10+ years of object oriented programming in Java translates over well to the thinking and expectations - but the syntax and different ways of doing things were far from natural for a java programmer (especially one who had respectfully ignored the C way of doing things), so the demonstration received through pairing was immediately beneficial. (On second thought, ignoring C probably helped since I saw Objective-C as an OO language from the start - not as C)</p>

<p>A 2 hour session with Kent Beck <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=180375524276">sold on EBay for $405</a>. That would be quite the experience - would love to do that and see how he or someone else at his level does their craft.</p>
