        Software Development is Not "Computer Science"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>These <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/07/cesium-atoms-are-able-to-take-a-quantum-walk.ars">guys</a> are &quot;computer scientists&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a programmer, developer, architect etc does not in my opinion constitute being a &quot;computer scientist&quot; or working in &quot;computer science&quot;.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most general <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science">definition</a> of science can be used for &quot;developers&quot; if we stretch:</p>

<blockquote>- a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws:Â the mathematical sciences.</blockquote>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t describe the whole of it like these definitions do:</p>

<blockquote>- systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.

- knowledge, as of facts or principles; knowledge gained by systematic study.</blockquote>

<p>As programmers we don&#39;t do this - we use technology (the &quot;applied science&quot;) to build things and solve problems.</p>

<p>We may sometimes pretend to venture into &quot;science&quot; as we &quot;research solutions&quot; - but we&#39;re just looking for knowledge and facts the &quot;scientists&quot; have figured out and then applying them in unique and novel ways.</p>

<p>Calling a programmer a scientist is like calling an artist a chemist because they use chemical compounds (paint, graphite, clay, steel, glue whatever).</p>

<p>Why does this matter to me?</p>

<p>Because by training our programmers in theoretical &quot;Computer Science&quot; educational programs, we are not actually creating employable or productive people. Sure, they have basic skills and theory that can then be applied through further effort - but unless they are one of the rare few to study, analyze and experiment with computer science theory - most of the knowledge gained serves little to no value in applying the techology of software development in real-world programming of software.</p>

        Detail Oriented
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>I&#39;m working on a fairly significant document that covers the requirements and high-level architecture for a new system based on SOA principles to replace an aging application.</p>

<p>The document is approaching 150 pages and beginning to approach something that properly describes the vision and needs so that business and technical folks can have a solid understanding of scope, requirements, priorities and how it will work (plus general direction on how it will be built).</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort and time to sit down and not only read, but understand the scope of this system. It&#39;s not a simple thing. As much as we try to keep it conceptually simple, there&#39;s a lot going on and a lot of details.</p>

<p>In a few weeks I&#39;m to sit down with a partner team to review and collaborate. My plan was to send over the detailed document for review so we could have a productive meeting to truly discuss missing requirements, strategy, execution planning etc.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve been told they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to read the detailed version -- just a summary -- bullet points with perhaps 10-15 pages.</p>

<p>These are senior developers and architects. Not high level business folks.</p>

<p>Attention to detail is in my opinion an absolute requirement for technical people. Decision making without details is dangerous and fairly useless.</p>

<p>My opinion is not high for people who do not care or have the attention span to be detail oriented.</p>

<p>An executive who&#39;s not directly involved in the operations of something - a summary makes sense.</p>

<p>A team or person who is supposed to directly impact the design and delivery of something and its ongoing operations - if the details aren&#39;t part of their focus, they don&#39;t deserve to be involved.</p>

<p>If they don&#39;t have the time to be detail oriented, then either they shouldn&#39;t be working on the project, their time needs to be re-prioritized, or the project isn&#39;t worth doing.</p>

        Recruiting IT Talent
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>An interesting <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2009/07/recruiting-elite-it-talent.html">article</a> by James McGovern on recruiting IT talent.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that it&#39;s very difficult to rely upon resumes, and that we as an industry seem to put up with &quot;falsification&quot; of skills and keep people onboard who really don&#39;t have the skills they need to do their job.</p>

<p>It closes with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>"World class organizations are built on foundations where people can trust each other and don't have to second guess the ability of the team. If you find yourself in a shop that doesn't get it and you stay, maybe you are getting exactly what you deserve... " - James McGovern</blockquote>
