    <p>I know this isn&#39;t my personal photo gallery -- that lives elsewhere -- but my wife sent the following picture to me yesterday while she was out with my baby girl and I admit, I&#39;m smitten. She&#39;s my little girl and I&#39;m wrapped around her finger.</p>

    <p>Twice in the last two weeks the Rackspace DFW (Dallas/Fort-Worth) data center has lost power to sections of its facility.</p>

<blockquote>Message from Rackspace CEO Lanham Napier

**June 30, 2009**

Rackspace community,

Yesterday afternoon at 3:15CDT our data center in Dallas experienced an interruption in power to portions of the facility.  The interruption caused customer servers to lose power and go down.

...

**Notice * July 7****, 2009, 11:44 am CDT: **Today a portion of our Dallas data center experienced a brief power interruption. Rackspace is aware of this issue and is currently investigating it. We will be sending out periodic updates as more information becomes available.

<p>I commend their transparency through the use of Twitter and their blog, but rather disconcerting since it&#39;s the datacenter I use and pay a premium for the amount of &quot;redundancy&quot; they are supposed to have, and the fact they had issues in <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2007/11/13/additional-details-on-rackspace-outages/">November 2007</a> as well. More information <a href="http://laughingsquid.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/massive-power-outage-at-rackspace-dallas-data-center/">here</a> about that <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/321909/rackspace-outage-was-third-in-two-days">outage</a>.</p>

    <p>In my ongoing collection of &quot;big guys having trouble&quot;, Google&#39;s &quot;App Engine&quot; services were <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/02/google_app_engine_fail/">down for 6 hours</a> on July 2nd.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/06/dziuba_google_app_engine/">scathing rant</a> about Google&#39;s lack of clarity on what went wrong and what&#39;s being done about it - and therefore the lack of confidence in using the service.</p>

        Impact of Tools on Productivity

    <span class="post-date">08 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>Yesterday I was <a href="http://benjchristensen.com/2009/07/07/netbeans-heap-profiler-works-well/">analyzing java heap dumps</a> at my office using a Mac Pro with 8 Xeon CPU cores and 16GB of memory.</p>

<p>It took 30-60 seconds to load a 3.5GB file and was very usable while browsing the heap and analyzing it.</p>

<p>When I got home I wanted to peruse it a little more. I just had my laptop, a MacBook Pro with a Core 2 Duo 2.5GHz and 4GB memory.</p>

<p>It took over 20 minutes just to load the file, and the machine was virtually unusable that entire time. Once loaded, every click of the mouse took time ranging from a noticeable lag to multiple seconds of being hung. The machine was swapping to death. Even though I have a very high end laptop, it just couldn&#39;t handle what I was throwing at it as compared to the very powerful desktop machine.</p>

<p>I gave up rather quickly as the <a href="http://benjchristensen.com/2009/06/26/speed-of-thought/">friction</a> of using the system was too high. I didn&#39;t have the patience to deal with it - I just waited until I returned to the office today and again used the Mac Pro.</p>

<p>It has made me think again about what kind of equipment is provided to development teams. I know for a fact that my extended team of 40+ overseas don&#39;t have a single machine in their office as powerful as the Mac Pro I was using.</p>

<p>So, if one of them needed to analyze that heap dump, profile a large server application or do some other intensive task, what would they do? Deal with 20 minute waits as opposed to 30 seconds, and multi-second pauses between each mouse click - and waste a day in their effort instead of minutes or hours of effective work allowing their tools to work as fast as their thoughts?</p>

<p>One could argue that a remote server, such as one at EC2 could be used for a couple hours by using a web based solution like JHat to analyze the heap. Except that <a href="http://twitter.com/benjchristensen/status/2534093699">didn&#39;t work</a> so well.</p>

<p>How much productivity is lost because a developer is given equipment below actual requirements, or by making them use the same machine long past its usefulness (3 years is an eternity for a developer, yet is a standard &#39;depreciation&#39; time for which a developer is often made to endure their machine).</p>

<p>For example, I have 4GB on my laptop and push on that limit constantly. Yet I know a lot of my team only has 2GB, and are working on CPU architectures several years old.</p>

<p>For a US developer this is just silly - as having new equipment every 18-24 months is a fraction of the cost of the persons salary, and in my opinion more than makes up for itself in improved productivity as well as morale.</p>

<p>For an offshore developer, with much lower salary costs it&#39;s a higher fraction, but still I believe its dividends are worth it.</p>

<p>This applies to all types of tools and equipment for developers: faster machines, more memory, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BigScreen.html">dual large monitors</a>, commercial software as opposed to everything being opensource and other such things.</p>

<p>People are expensive. I think it&#39;s more cost effective to spend a little on the right equipment and increase productivity and morale of development teams by giving them the right tools - as I had while analyzing heap dumps.</p>
