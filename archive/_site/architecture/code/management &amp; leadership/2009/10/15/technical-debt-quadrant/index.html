  <p>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">wrote a blog entry</a> on technical debt this week that communicates the concepts of &quot;technical debt&quot; and classifies them very well.</p>

<p><a href="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/techdebtquadrant.png"><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/techdebtquadrant.png" alt="techDebtQuadrant"></a></p>

<p>Some favorite portions:</p>

<blockquote>"A mess is a reckless debt which results in crippling interest payments or a long period of paying down the principal."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prudent debt to reach a release may not be worth paying down if the interest payments are sufficiently small - such as if it were in a rarely touched part of the code-base."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not just is there a difference between prudent and reckless debt, there's also a difference between deliberate and inadvertent debt. The prudent debt example is deliberate because the team knows they are taking on a debt, and thus puts some thought as to whether the payoff for an earlier release is greater than the costs of paying it off. A team ignorant of design practices is taking on its reckless debt without even realizing how much hock it's getting into."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"while you're programming, you are learning. It's often the case that it can take a year of programming on a project before you understand what the best design approach should have been. Perhaps one should plan projects to spend a year building a system that you throw away and rebuild, but that's a tricky plan to sell. Instead what you find is that the moment you realize what the design should have been, you also realize that you have an inadvertent debt."</blockquote>
