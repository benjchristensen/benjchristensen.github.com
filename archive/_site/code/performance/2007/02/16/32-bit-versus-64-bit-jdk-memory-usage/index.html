  <h1 class="post-title">32-bit versus 64-bit JDK Memory Usage</h1>
  <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2007</span>
  <p>Summary of analysis performed September 2006.</p>

<p>Testing Strategy</p>

<p>To ensure the tests performed were reliable and behaved the same every time with as few variables as possible, a simple program (a single java class) was written which loops indefinitely, adding objects to a collection until it runs out of memory.</p>

<p>This test was performed with both Integer and String objects, and then executed with 3 different JVMs with varying heap settings.</p>

<p>The results and details of these tests are documented in later chapters.</p>

<p>JVMs tested:
- JDK 1.4.2 32-bit
- JDK 1.5 32-bit
- JDK 1.5 64-bit</p>

<p>Operating Systems Tested
- Solaris 10 on Opterons
- Suse Linux 10 on Opterons</p>

<p>The tests are far from exhaustive, but were enough to derive numbers and patterns whereby the JVMs can be sized accurately and recommendations made.</p>

<p>Findings</p>

<ul>
<li>Tests performed consistently on both Linux and Solaris (except for maximum heap sizes)</li>
<li>JDK 5 64-bit takes between 40% - 50% more memory on average than either 32-bit JVM</li>
<li><p>JDK 1.4 32-bit is slightly more memory efficient than JDK 5 32-bit
o It is slightly better than JDK 5 32-bit in Integer tests
o It is exactly the same as JDK 5 32-bit in String tests</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris 10 can run a 32-bit JVM up to 3.5GB</p></li>
<li><p>Suse Linux can run a 32-bit JVM up to 2GB</p></li>
<li><p>A 64-bit JVM was successfully run at 20GB on Suse Linux</p></li>
<li><p>A 2GB 32-bit JVM is approximately equivalent to a 3GB 64-bit JVM in number of objects stored
o ie. On Suse Linux, if more than 2GB heap is needed, then one must jump to a 3GB 64-bit JVM to achieve the same amount of storage
o ie. On Solaris, if more than 3.5GB heap is needed, then one must jump to a 5GB 64-bit JVM to achieve the same amount of storage</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations</p>

<p>Based upon these findings, it is recommended that JDK 5 32-bit be used as the default JVM, and 64-bit used if more memory is needed than what can be allocated to a 32-bit JVM with the understanding of the ratio one must increase to account for the change to a 64-bit data model.</p>

<p>The reasons for choosing JDK 5 over JDK 1.4 are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JDK 5 is the current recommended production JVM from Sun Microsystems
o It has been out for more than 2 years and is at its 8th maintenance release (JDK 1.5_08)</p></li>
<li><p>General performance improvements from JDK 1.4 to JDK 5
o http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/performance/speed.html
o http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/vm/index.html</p></li>
<li><p>Improved garbage collection algorithms, particularly for multi-processor machines
o http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/gc<em>tuning</em>5.html</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit JVM available on AMD Opterons when larger heap sizes required (not available for JDK 1.4)
o http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html#platform_proc64</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>The tests performed confirmed that the 64-bit JVM does indeed use more memory than the 32-bit JVMs, but that it behaves consistently and can be calculated, and therefore planned for.
It is recommended to use JDK 5 32-bit as the default JVM, and the 64-bit variant when larger heap sizes are required.</p>
