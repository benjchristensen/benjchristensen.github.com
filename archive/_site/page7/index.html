        Initial Impressions on Ruby Performance
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve spent the past day playing with Ruby and decided to test some basic performance - iterating and string parsing - to get an idea of what the performance is really like.</p>

<p>Ruby is not doing so well in my tests.</p>

<p><em>Note to Ruby Experts: If anyone can demonstrate what I&#39;m doing wrong in my code or testing, I would love to be corrected.</em></p>

<p>My approach was to write the exact same code in Java and Ruby that loads up a file, reads each lines, tokenizes it into words using whitespace as the delimiter and counts up the tokens.</p>

<p>This avoids network or database IO and other external resources - except the filesystem which I don&#39;t consider a significant variable in the test.</p>

<p>Further testing I&#39;m planning on doing will test Rails, multi-threading and other common things I do in my apps.</p>

        Software Development Is Not Engineering
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>I have long considered it a fallacy to call software development &quot;engineering&quot;. Even though the term technically works for software as &quot;the science, discipline, art and profession of acquiring and applying technical, scientific and mathematical knowledge to design and implement structures, machines, devices, systems, and processes that safely realize a desired objective or inventions&quot; (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering">Wikipedia</a>), this is not how the term ends up being interpreted and therefore misrepresents how software development actually occurs - since engineering has become synonymous with building physical structures such as buildings, bridges, roads. Recently someone with authority on the subject expressed this opinion much better than I could have, and since he has authority on the subject and in the industry, it means something.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco">Tom DeMarco</a> has authored over nine books and 100 papers on project management and software development&quot; and has been intimately involved over the past 40 years in the software industry and the establishment of &quot;structured analysis&quot;, software project management concepts and legendary software development projects such as the first large scale telephone exchange for Bell.</p>

<p>He recently wrote an article titled &quot;<a href="http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/0709/rW_SO_Viewpoints.pdf">Software Engineering:  An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?</a>&quot;</p>

<p>The article is well written and there is no value in me repeating it verbatim, so read the original.</p>

<p>The following quotes however are worth me repeating along with my commentary:</p>

<blockquote>"**Software development is inherently different from a natural science** such as physics and its metrics are accordingly much less precise."</blockquote>

<p>Software development is not like building a bridge - where the materials, laws of physics and chemistry, labor times etc have all been experienced and practiced thousands of times, can be accurately predicted and correctly planned for, then managed.</p>

<blockquote>"**Software development is and always will be somewhat experimental.** The actual software construction isn’t necessarily experimental, but its conception is. And this is where our focus ought to be. It’s where our focus always ought to have been."</blockquote>

<p>If we are writing software, it&#39;s because we&#39;re trying to do something that hasn&#39;t been done before or is different in some way from what already exists, otherwise we&#39;ll purchase the existing software. We are building a solution to a problem - to create value of some kind.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re doing something that hasn&#39;t been done before - either with new technologies, new rules, new performance criteria or whatever it is that makes it unique - then we are doing &quot;research and development&quot; - experimentation. It is not as if a blueprint for a house is given and the construction team comes in to build it as they&#39;ve done 1000 other houses in the same community. Software &quot;architecture&quot; doesn&#39;t work that way. There is never a replicate - because it&#39;s not physical.</p>

<p>Yet business and project management would love it to be - it makes it easier to control, schedule and most critically, budget for.</p>

<p>Tom DeMarco discusses &quot;metrics&quot; in the most detail in the article, about why we spend so much time trying to control software development projects, and particularly the timeline/cost aspect.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>"**For the past 40 years, for example, we’ve tortured ourselves over our inability to finish a software project on time and on budget**. But as I hinted earlier, this never should have been the supreme goal. **The more important goal is transformation**, creating software that changes the world or that transforms a company or how it does business."</blockquote>

<p>After giving an example of two projects, one creating little value and one creating significant value he states:</p>

<blockquote>"This leads us to the odd conclusion that **strict control is something that matters a lot on relatively useless projects** and much less on useful projects. It suggests that **the more you focus on control, the more likely you’re working on a project that’s striving to deliver something of relatively minor value.**"</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, I&#39;ve generally seen the opposite perspective from business - that the &quot;expensive&quot; projects, the ones typically capable of creating the most value, are the ones where the most control of timeline and cost is desired and therefore the most damage done by &quot;management&quot; as opposed to allowing the necessary experimentation, design, thought, research and development to occur to create the most value out of the software.</p>

<p>Being criticized of being &quot;unable to delivery on time&quot; in software development is not something I can really take personally - when the industry at large struggles so significantly with this, largely because it has tried so desperately to liken software development to a public works engineering project such as building a bridge, a building or a road.</p>

<p>Software development is more like art than most seem willing to accept.</p>

<p>It is driven by creativity, experimentation, research, design and artistic drive.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the &quot;transformative&quot; software projects most often come from startups (Apple apparently being the exception with their iPhone OS and demonstrating the amazing culture of design they allow to flourish) and then as they mature become stagnant once quarterly reports drive business as opposed to the development of a product? Or that opensource, where timelines mean nothing, can build great software such as Linux, Firefox and MySQL? Look at what has happened to MySQL over the past 2 years as business &quot;management&quot; has replaced &quot;experimentation&quot; and focus on quality -- the key people who built MySQL over the years have left to work on something where strict control is not the focus.</p>

<p>As Tom DeMarco suggests, I hope to be focusing on development where the value is worth allowing the proper time, people, experimentation and development to occur - so that something of true value can be created. If management of &quot;costs&quot; is the most important aspect of the project, the greatest value to be created, I don&#39;t even want to bother. I&#39;d rather work on a project that has the ability to be transformative, and create greater value than the cost of the effort.</p>

        Apprenticing to Learn Software Development
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>The foundation of my software development skills was set between 1995 and 1998 while I worked under the direction of my friend and mentor Andre Kruger. For a long time I called it &quot;job shadowing&quot;, but I have come to realize that it was an informal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a>.</p>

<p>I have found those 3 years taught me more about software, system administration and technology than most get the opportunity to experience that early in their career - as I was learning and working on the job, tutored by someone who was incredibly intelligent and had years of knowledge and experience to share. He also provide me with invaluable insights and suggestions on what technologies and platforms to follow. It was he who suggested Java (when it was at version 1.0) was what I should focus on, not C - and that has served me well to this day - when the schools were telling me to learn Pascal.</p>

<p>I loved it and sucked up as much as I could learn. I also built software that did real things. Now I recognize how poor the code was - it was very bad. The point was that I was learning through doing real things in an environment where I couldn&#39;t do significant damage and could receive instruction and guidance - and eventually as I progressed I could truly understand the benefits of design patterns, object oriented design and what it meant to be &quot;in production&quot;. It wasn&#39;t theoretical - or some forcefully memorized and quickly forgotten trivia - I knew it.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t complete college/university - because by the time I got there it bored me to tears, as I had spent several years being apprenticed already and learned quickly on my own through books and experimentation. If I could have, I would have skipped to 3rd year and enjoyed myself, but our society and academic programs don&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>I believe apprenticeships are the ideal way to learn software development, as I see software as a craft - not an engineering or scientific skill where rules are learned and applied the same way every time.</p>

<p>I wish our society and industry would look seriously at its academic and theoretical approach to training - which I feel does not work very well - and consider a model more similar to apprenticeship.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy mentoring others who have raw talent and desire. Some of my most rewarding work of the past 5 years has been that which has resulted in colleagues progressing and growing, such as a good friend of mine <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/amemon">Adnan Memon</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;ve accomplished the &quot;master&quot; status in certain aspects of my work, in others I&#39;m still a &quot;journeyman&quot; I&#39;m sure. I hope to find others who can continue to mentor me as I try do so for my juniors, as I think that&#39;s where the best talent in our industry comes from.</p>

        Learning by Pair Programming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>Last week I learned how to program on the iPhone using Objective-C and Cocoa Touch by having two 2-hour pair programming sessions with <a href="http://twitter.com/coursey">Brent Coursey</a> and about 8 hours of my own playing around.</p>

<p>I am comfortable now with XCode, Interface Building and Objective-C - enough that I can build code to do what I want it to do, compile, run, debug, test and install on my personal iPhone.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve connected to web services via Objective-C and built a user interface to interact with the services.</p>

<p>All in all it was a good experience and great way to learn - and the pair programming was very useful in speeding up the learning process. Unlike 10 years ago where I plenty of time to learn through trial and error, it was much more effective to sit and watch someone and see how everything worked together. I was able to pick it up very quickly that way.</p>

<p>Of course, 10+ years of object oriented programming in Java translates over well to the thinking and expectations - but the syntax and different ways of doing things were far from natural for a java programmer (especially one who had respectfully ignored the C way of doing things), so the demonstration received through pairing was immediately beneficial. (On second thought, ignoring C probably helped since I saw Objective-C as an OO language from the start - not as C)</p>

<p>A 2 hour session with Kent Beck <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=180375524276">sold on EBay for $405</a>. That would be quite the experience - would love to do that and see how he or someone else at his level does their craft.</p>
