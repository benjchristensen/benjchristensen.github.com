  <h1 class="post-title">My Job Hunt - How I Ended Up At Apple</h1>
  <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2010</span>
  <p>I started working for Apple in their iTunes Store division on December 14th 2009. It&#39;s been a great 6 weeks so far and I look forward to a long and interesting future here at Apple.</p>

<p>Considering the state of the economy and job market I consider myself blessed to have gotten such a great new job - but I worked hard in my hunt and thought it might be of use or interest to others what it took to find a new job.</p>

<p>So, my job hunt &quot;by the numbers&quot; ...</p>

<p><strong>Time on Hunt</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>14 weeks (4 1/2 months)</p></li>
<li><p>August 11th to November 18th</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Job Boards Used</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>7+</p></li>
<li><p>Dice, TheLadder, Monster, Jobirn, Indeed, CyberCoders, SimplyHired</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cost (in money, not time)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$1000+</p></li>
<li><p>$700 on resume</p></li>
<li><p>expenses that weren&#39;t reimbursed during interviews I traveled to</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Friends or Colleagues Notified</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6 (It was a private affair for the first 3/4s of the search)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cities I Looked At</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Virtually anywhere in the US with a big city ....</p></li>
<li><p>In particular I was pursuing cities in the following order...</p>

<ul>
<li>Denver (cause that&#39;s where I lived and own a home)</li>
<li>Austin</li>
<li>Dallas</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
<li>Las Vegas</li>
<li>Southern California</li>
<li>Northern California</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I considered East Coast and that direction (New York, Virginia, DC, Chicago etc) after finding opportunities out there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Jobs Applied or Responded To *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>59 or more not counting the many emails I received and ignored outright</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outright Rejections</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies Who Ignored Me</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>30+ whom I never heard from even after attempted followups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advanced Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source of Leads (for those 6)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>2 - recruiter found my resume on a job board and contacted me</p></li>
<li><p>1 - I responded to a posting on a job board</p></li>
<li><p>2 - I submitted to job postings directly on the company site</p></li>
<li><p>1 - friend referred me to a job at his company after seeing me post on LinkedIn that I was looking (in the last 1/4 of my search when I made it public)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Number of Engineers that Interviewed Me at Those 6 Companies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>30+</p>

<ul>
<li>12 at one company, 10 at another</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flights to Onsite Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>4</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicago</li>
<li>Cupertino</li>
<li>San Francisco</li>
<li>Carlsbad (San Diego County)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Offers Received</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rejections After Advanced Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it was a great experience. I learned a lot about myself, my worth, what I&#39;m interested in and what opportunities are out there for me.</p>

<p>I had been at Etilize for 7 1/2 years and NEVER gotten a job via a resume before, so this was a significant experience for me to go &quot;out of the blue&quot; searching for a job and get one without having connections before hand.</p>

<p>A few things that I found significant in the process:</p>

<p><strong>1) Get a Professional Resume</strong></p>

<p>Paying for a professional resume writer to redo my resume made a HUGE difference. It made me feel much more confident about sending it off, but I also got much better feedback and callbacks once I began using it. It was completely worth the money and I&#39;d recommend it to anybody serious about their job hunt.</p>

<p>As for the high cost -- don&#39;t go cheap is my opinion. Think about how long it takes to do a good job, the hourly rate you want to be paid and you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s impossible to have a proper job for $150 - which you&#39;ll see advertised. I paid $700 and it was deserved.</p>

<p><strong>2) It Takes Time</strong></p>

<p>Plan for it to take longer than you want or expect. It all takes time.</p>

<p><strong>3) Study</strong></p>

<p>The questions I was asked are things that NEVER get asked or come up in the &quot;real world&quot; and are things I&#39;d typically Google.</p>

<p>Sometimes that&#39;s a valid answer ... &quot;I&#39;d Google that&quot; ... but it won&#39;t get you far on most interviews.</p>

<p>I had to dust off my understanding on a lot of computer science theory, algorithms, data structures, and other such things. In fact, the one major set of interviews I went through and ultimately got rejected from was the first series I went through and I believe 3 things caused the rejection (not my lack of skill):</p>

<p>a) questions about things I hadn&#39;t studied (and studied thereafter and was prepared for in subsequent interviews)</p>

<p>b) I was over-dressed ... a suit and tie for an engineering position set the wrong tone</p>

<p>c) I was not myself and stressed (this was more to do with the fact that it was my first real interviews in a decade ... ok, ever...)</p>

<p>It was really frustrating at times and absolutely exhilarating at others ... a real roller-coaster all the way through. By the end though I had a better sense of value and who I am and an exciting new career path.</p>

<p>Good luck to anyone else reading this and doing their own search!</p>
