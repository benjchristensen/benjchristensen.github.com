        Hystrix Dashboard + Turbine Stream Aggregator
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2013</span>

    <p>Originally posted to the <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/12/hystrix-dashboard-and-turbine.html">Netflix Tech Blog</a>:</p>

<p>by Ben Christensen, Puneet Oberai and Ben Schmaus</p>

<p><a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/11/hystrix.html">Two weeks ago</a> we introduced <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a>, a library for engineering resilience into distributed systems. Today we&#39;re open sourcing the Hystrix dashboard application, as well as a new companion project called Turbine that provides low latency event stream aggregation.  </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">
<img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hystrix-logo-tagline-github-link-640.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>The Hystrix dashboard has significantly improved our operations by reducing discovery and recovery times during operational events. The duration of most production incidents (already less frequent due to Hystrix) is far shorter, with diminished impact, because we are now able to get realtime insights (1-2 second latency) into system behavior.  </p>

<p>The following snapshot shows six HystrixCommands being used by the Netflix API.  Under the hood of this example dashboard, Turbine is aggregating data from 581 servers into a single stream of metrics supporting the dashboard application, which in turn streams the aggregated data to the browser for display in the UI.  </p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hystrix-dashboard-netflix-api-example-620.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When a circuit is failing then it changes colors (gradient from green through yellow, orange and red) such as this:</p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dashboard-example-open-circuit-640.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The diagram below shows one &quot;circuit&quot; from the dashboard along with explanations of what all of the data represents.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve purposefully tried to pack a lot of information into the dashboard so that engineers can quickly consume and correlate data.  </p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dashboard-annoted-circuit-640.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The following video shows the dashboard operating with data from a Netflix API cluster:  </p>

<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWM7oAbVL4g?vq=hd720&amp;w=640&amp;h=360]</p>

<p>The Turbine deployment at Netflix connects to thousands of Hystrix-enabled servers and aggregates realtime streams from them. Netflix uses Turbine with a <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> plugin that handles instances joining and leaving clusters (due to autoscaling, red/black deployments, or just being unhealthy).  </p>

<p>Our alerting systems have also started migrating to Turbine-powered metrics streams so that in one minute of data there are dozens or hundreds of points of data for a single metric. This high resolution of metrics data makes for better and faster alerting.  </p>

<p>The Hystrix dashboard can be used either to monitor an individual instance without Turbine or in conjunction with Turbine to monitor multi-machine clusters:  </p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dashboard-direct-vs-turbine-640.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Turbine can be found on Github at: <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine">https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine</a>  </p>

<p>Dashboard documentation is at: <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Dashboard">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Dashboard</a>  </p>

<p>We expect people to want to customize the UI so the javascript modules have been implemented in a way that they can easily be used standalone in existing dashboards and applications. We also expect different perspectives on how to visualize and represent data and look forward to contributions back to both Hystrix and Turbine.  </p>

<p>We are always looking for talented engineers so if you&#39;re interested in this type of work contact us via <a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/jobs.html">jobs.netflix.com</a>.  </p>

        Hystrix for Resilience Engineering
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Nov 2012</span>

    <p>Today Hystrix was released on GitHub at <a href="http://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">http://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix</a>.</p>

<p>It is a latency and fault tolerance library used for resilience engineering and something I have spent a good chunk of time on at Netflix. I&#39;m happy to see it get released as open-source and be able to continue evolving it (hopefully with community involvement).</p>

<p>As written originally for the <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/11/hystrix.html">Netflix Tech Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In a distributed environment, failure of any given service is inevitable. Hystrix is a library designed to control the interactions between these distributed services providing greater tolerance of latency and failure. Hystrix does this by isolating points of access between the services, stopping cascading failures across them, and providing fallback options, all of which improve the system's overall resiliency.

Hystrix evolved out of resilience engineering work that the Netflix API team began in 2011. Over the course of 2012, Hystrix continued to evolve and mature, eventually leading to adoption across many teams within Netflix. Today tens of billions of thread-isolated and hundreds of billions of semaphore-isolated calls are executed via Hystrix every day at Netflix and a dramatic improvement in uptime and resilience has been achieved through its use.</blockquote>

        Performance and Fault Tolerance for the Netflix API - QCon Sao Paulo
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>A presentation I gave at QCon Sao Paulo on August 4th 2012 (http://qconsp.com/palestrante/ben-christensen)</p>

<p><strong>Presentation Description</strong></p>

<p>The Netflix API receives over a billion requests a day which translates into multiple billions of calls to underlying systems in the Netflix service-oriented architecture. These requests come from more than 800 different devices ranging from gaming consoles like the PS3, XBox and Wii to set-top boxes, TVs and mobile devices such as Android and iOS.</p>

<p>This presentation describes how the Netflix API supports those devices and achieves fault tolerance in a distributed architecture while depending on dozens of systems which can fail at any time. It also explains how a new system design allows each device to optimize API calls to their unique needs and leverage concurrency on the server-side to improve their performance.</p>

<p>(Some slides have been modified and notes included for readability and understanding of content without accompanying speech.)</p>

    <p>Continuing with the series of examples I&#39;ve provided while using d3.js, this one is a javascript object which renders data as a line graph which can then be interacted with by scrubbing over it or changing the y-axis scale.</p>
