title: Hystrix in May 2013 ThoughtWorks Tech Radar
---

[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) was listed in the [May 2013 Tech Radar](http://thoughtworks.fileburst.com/assets/technology-radar-may-2013.pdf) by ThoughtWorks as "Assess" under the Tools section.



<blockquote>Managing dependencies in distributed systems can become 
complicated, and is a problem more people are facing with the 
move to finer-grained micro services. Hystrix is a library for 
the JVM from Netflix that implements patterns for dealing with 
downstream failure, offers real-time monitoring of connections, 
and caching and batching mechanisms to make inter-service 
dependencies more efficient.</blockquote>
