title: Making the Netflix API More Resilient
---

A new [Netflix Tech Blog post](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/12/making-netflix-api-more-resilient.html) by my manager ([Ben Schmaus](https://twitter.com/#!/schmaus)) discusses how we've been making the Netflix API more resilient through the use of circuit breakers, bounded thread-pools and realtime decision making:


<blockquote>Here are some of the key principles that informed our thinking as we set out to make the API more resilient.

> 
> 
	
>   1. A failure in a service dependency should not break the user experience for members
> 
	
>   2. The API should automatically take corrective action when one of its service dependencies fails
> 
	
>   3. The API should be able to show us whatâ€™s happening right now, in addition to what was happening 15-30 minutes ago, yesterday, last week, etc.

</blockquote>
