Eclipse still does not ship with subversion support by default.

Here's how I enabled it. Much easier than with Ganymede, but I still shouldn't have to do this considering Subversion is used by 57.5% of the Eclipse users who responded to the recent survey.

See page 3 of http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/Eclipse_Survey_2009_final.pdf:


<blockquote>"Subversion is the dominant Source Code Management system used byÂ developers, with 57.5%."</blockquote>


Anyways, the following screenshots show how to install it from "Help -> Install New Software".



	
  * The first site "Galileo" is already included in Eclipse 3.5.

	
  * The second site is the following URL: **http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/**
