Twice in the last two weeks the Rackspace DFW (Dallas/Fort-Worth) data center has lost power to sections of its facility.


<blockquote>Message from Rackspace CEO Lanham Napier

**June 30, 2009**

Rackspace community,

Yesterday afternoon at 3:15CDT our data center in Dallas experienced an interruption in power to portions of the facility.  The interruption caused customer servers to lose power and go down.

...

**Notice * July 7****, 2009, 11:44 am CDT: **Today a portion of our Dallas data center experienced a brief power interruption. Rackspace is aware of this issue and is currently investigating it. We will be sending out periodic updates as more information becomes available.

I commend their transparency through the use of Twitter and their blog, but rather disconcerting since it's the datacenter I use and pay a premium for the amount of "redundancy" they are supposed to have, and the fact they had issues in [November 2007](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2007/11/13/additional-details-on-rackspace-outages/) as well. More information [here](http://laughingsquid.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/massive-power-outage-at-rackspace-dallas-data-center/) about that [outage](http://valleywag.gawker.com/321909/rackspace-outage-was-third-in-two-days).
