title: Web Service Performance with Netli/Akamai
---

Web Service tests performed against Netli and Akamai.

First column is origin, second is Netli, third is Akamai.

Each test executed the same request/response 25 times and gave the average.

It alternated between each of the 3 sources, doing 1 request at a time, so a total of 75 in a single test.

NOTE: Servers are located in Los Angeles -- so the times for the client also being in Los Angeles are deceiving.
