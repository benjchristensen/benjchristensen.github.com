Just been playing with WTP 1.0 from Eclipse to see if I can use it instead of MyEclipseIDE.

It took some playing around to get it working and a feel for it ... it's pretty close to being able to take care of everything we need ... without the bloat that MyEclipseIDE is becoming.

It also seems to have a nice server deployment/management system ...

This particular bug is the clincher that's making me wait until 1.5 is released to re-evaluate.
