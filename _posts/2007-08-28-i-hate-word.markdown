I hate Microsoft Word tonight.

I put columns in my document, so it creates a new "section" around each one.

That then means that page numbering is all screwed up -- and even though I tell it to continue page numbering from the previous section it still doesn't do so -- so I either can't have page numbering correct in my TOC and footers, or I can't use columns.

I HATE WORD.

Wordperfect had this all working properly like 15 years ago in version 5.1 ... and it let me actually see the stupid codes instead of hiding it all behind a useless GUI.
