I'm running Eclipse 3.2M4 and WTP 1.5M4 and so far things seem to be working well.

It's a pain to convert a MyEclipse project in SVN, but straightforward ...

When checking out from CVS/SVN, if a .project file exists, it automatically configures the project with that. To allow me to checkout the project as a "Dynamic Web App", I had to delete the .project file in SVN first.

The files I removed in SVN are:

.project
.classpath

Here is an image showing the project in Eclipse.

This next picture shows how my "Project Preferences" looks ... particularly the "Project Facets" which is how WTP dictates what a project is ... Java and Dynamic Web Module are necessary ones.

This picture shows the server manager.

I personally don't like waiting for validation so I turned off several of the validators. The following picture shows it.
