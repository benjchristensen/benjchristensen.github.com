For the rare scenario I need to use Windows I have XP installed in Parallels 4 on my Mac.

I got a new machine today so copied everything over and in doing so had to re-install Parallels.Â 

XP needs to be re-activated again, but it won't do so by the internet for whatever reason. I have to call Microsoft.

So I do so ... and after speaking to a computer ALL of the digits in the screenshot below it says I need to talk to a human. I get somebody in India who then tells me their computers aren't working and that I'll have to call back in 20-30 minutes.

Not only does Microsoft make their software stop working for me, the tech support I call doesn't have their software running either.

Lovely.
