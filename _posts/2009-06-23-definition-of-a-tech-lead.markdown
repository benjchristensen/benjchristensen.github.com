Good summary of a "tech lead" <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2009/06/enterprise-architecture-so-exactly-what.html">by James McGovern</a>:

If you are in this role and want to live up to your title, then you need the following skills:



	
  * Accountable - The buck stops here, someone who can shoulder the responsibility without pointing fingers at others.

	
  * Adaptable - Life changes fast, if can't change with the times, you'll be left behind.

	
  * Approachable - their team can ask them questions and talk to them.

	
  * Attentive - they actually listen to their team and understand them.

	
  * Aware - they're aware of what is going on around them instead of sticking their head in the sand.

	
  * Can type - No hen peck typists need apply in this industry.

	
  * Charismatic - People have got to want to listen to you.

	
  * Communicative - You've got to want to communicate with your team.

	
  * Competent - You've gotta know your stuff.

	
  * Confident - If you're not confident in yourself, how is anyone else going to be?

	
  * Decisive - can make decisions themselves and be accountable for them.

	
  * Driven - You've gotta see the goal and go right after it.

	
  * Focused - You've gotta have the staying power to keep going and reach the goal.

	
  * Inspirational - this is the most important one for me! If you can't inspire people, what are you doing?

	
  * Meticulous - The truth is in the details.

	
  * Nurturing - The test of a good teacher is when their students surpass them.

	
  * Resourceful - You've gotta be able to find the answers to the things you don't know.

	
  * Technically minded - In this industry at least.

	
  * Understanding - If your team don't think you understand them, they won't bother trying to understand you.


As a leader, it's your delegates that help build your success. Treat them like gold, and they will do the same for you. One non-programmer that can inspire 10 "average" programmers to greatness is worth more than one great programmer who can't inspire their team to do more than meet their job requirements...
