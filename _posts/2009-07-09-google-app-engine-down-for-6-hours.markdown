title: Google App Engine Down for 6 Hours
---

In my ongoing collection of "big guys having trouble", Google's "App Engine" services were [down for 6 hours](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/02/google_app_engine_fail/) on July 2nd.

A [scathing rant](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/06/dziuba_google_app_engine/) about Google's lack of clarity on what went wrong and what's being done about it - and therefore the lack of confidence in using the service.

Google's posting about the issue are found [here](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-downtime-notify/browse_thread/thread/f7596d1d0bd0f0f9?hl=en&pli=1).
