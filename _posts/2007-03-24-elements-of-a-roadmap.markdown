I found a good list of elements for a roadmap by [NickMalik](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/03/12/so-what-s-in-a-roadmap-anyway.aspx)



	
  * Purpose of this Document  - why write the doc

	
  * Stakeholder Chart - whose needs are being met with the solution

	
  * Signoff Chart - timestamp and id of person who signs off.

	
  * High Level Platform Capabilities - the solution capabilities demanded by the business

	
  * Business Drivers for the Capabilities - the list of business programs or business teams that will use the system

	
  * Capability Demand - which business are asking for which capabilities.  An interesting grid.

	
  * Technical Interdependencies - what other systems rely on this solution.  What other systems does this solution rely on?

	
  * Enterprise Architecture Concerns - what agreements have been made with EA to get alignment of the solution to EA standards.

	
  * Architectural Context - one or more diagrams showing how the solution platform will evolve over time.

	
  * Methodology - how this document and concensus was created.  What meetings were held.  Who was in the room.  (it matters)

	
  * Roadmap schedule - what timelines everything thinks are reasonable for delivering the needs to different business customers

	
  * System Quality Attributes - what quality attributes will be stressed in each of the iterations.

	
  * Alternatives considered - what alternatives to this roadmap were considered and why this one was chosen.

	
  * Roadmap Risks - what could go wrong and who is assigned to watch for it

	
  * Platform Historical Narrative - previous decisions and narrative so that we can always answer the question: how did we ever get in a bind like this?
