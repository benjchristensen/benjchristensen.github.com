  <p>Good article interviewing Henry Kissinger: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=8010889">http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=8010889</a></p>

<p>Some good quotes from it:</p>

<p>SPIEGEL: Despite the failure of Versailles, this Wilsonian idea is remarkably prevalent. Is our affinity to the ideals of democracy perhaps naïve?</p>

<p>Kissinger: The belief in democracy as a universal remedy regularly reappears in American foreign policy. Its most recent appearance came with the so-called neocons in the Bush administration. Actually, Obama is much closer to a realistic policy on this issue than Bush was.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>SPIEGEL: Do concepts like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; make sense in the context of foreign policy?</p>

<p>Kissinger: Yes, but generally in gradations. Rarely in absolutes. I think there are kinds of evil that need to be condemned and destroyed, and one should not apologize for that. But one should not use the existence of evil as an excuse for those who think that they represent good to insist on an unlimited right to impose their definition of their values.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>SPIEGEL: What&#39;s the difference between the conflicts in Europe in the early 20th century and the conflicts we are facing in today&#39;s world?</p>

<p>Kissinger: In previous periods, the victor could promise itself some benefit. Under the current circumstances,that no longer applies. A clash between China and the United States,for example, would undermine both countries.</p>
