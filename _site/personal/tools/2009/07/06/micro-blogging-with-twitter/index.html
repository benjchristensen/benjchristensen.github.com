  <h1 class="post-title">Micro-Blogging with Twitter</h1>
  <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2009</span>
  <p>I started using Twitter about 2 weeks ago. Before that I thought Twitter was a silly thing. Why would I want to post &quot;what I&#39;m doing&quot; at any given moment?</p>

<p>However, a handful of people whose blogs I follow began migrating more and more of their commentary to Twitter. In fact, one of them retired from blogging and only uses Twitter now. Thus, I started an account so I could follow these few people.</p>

<p>I soon came to recognize Twitter for what it can actually be used for - micro-blogging. It&#39;s not just &quot;status updates&quot; as used by teens, tweens and soccer moms - but a viable communication platform for short thoughts and messages that would often go un-written, un-shared, un-communicated (pardon the poor grammar) because traditional blogging (if a 5 year old concept can be considered traditional) needs more content than a single sentence to be bothered with.</p>

<p>To post a blog entry it needs at least a title plus a paragraph.</p>

<p>With Twitter, you just need the title.</p>

<p>Thus, the sharing of thoughts, ideas, quotes, links etc all become more natural because there is less friction in doing so.</p>

<p>As I commented in an earlier post on &quot;<a href="http://benjchristensen.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/speed-of-thought/">Speed of Thought</a>&quot;, if something has friction, it it less likely to be used or performed. The same with sharing of thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>Blogging reduced the friction greatly from the techniques before it, and Twitter (or micro-blogging more generically) appears to be doing the same for a realm of communication previously not very feasible to attempt.</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://twitter.com/benjchristensen">posted 83 messages</a> in 18 days since starting - some benign, others more thoughtful. A mixture of personal and professional.</p>

<p>I do not see Twitter as a replacement of blogs. I see them as very compatible mediums that mix together to create a stream of thoughts and ideas - to be shared and create dialog. In fact, I have mixed them now on this blog as shown by the Twitter feed in the right column, providing a single place to find my thoughts - both those well thought out and edited as blog entries, and those more &quot;sound bite&quot; sized from Twitter.</p>

<p>Despite my views on the subject just 3 weeks ago, I now think Twitter is a valuable addition to our communication toolset alongside email, RSS and blogs.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still questioning the significance of Twitter and think it&#39;s just celebrities, teens and tweens, check out some of the following which are a few I follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(CNN Breaking News) <a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse">https://twitter.com/cnnbrk</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Reuters News) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters">https://twitter.com/Reuters</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Al Jazeera News) <a href="https://twitter.com/AJEnglish">https://twitter.com/AJEnglish</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Application Architect) <a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler">https://twitter.com/martinfowler</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Enterprise Architect) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcgoverntheory">https://twitter.com/mcgoverntheory</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Data Center) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rackspace">https://twitter.com/Rackspace</a></p></li>
<li><p>(USA White House) <a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse">https://twitter.com/whitehouse</a></p></li>
<li><p>(Muse - a great band) <a href="https://twitter.com/musewire">https://twitter.com/musewire</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that companies, news agencies and governments are using the medium for instant communication - not just personal friends - is an amazing convergence of parties making the medium that much more powerful and useful.</p>

<p>Communicating and staying in touch with so many diverse parties has never had as little friction as this.</p>
