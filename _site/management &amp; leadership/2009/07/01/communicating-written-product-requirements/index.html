  <h1 class="post-title">Communicating Product Requirements</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2009</span>
  <p>I&#39;ve spent the last day considering product and/or project requirements - in particular how to document and communicate them.</p>

<p>A draft of a requirements document numbering in excess of 100 pages has very thoroughly covered the technical definitions of all of the various &#39;features&#39; - what the system needs to contain. However, it reads like a dictionary definition and does not in any way help me understand the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the business purpose of the product?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the business purpose of a particular requirement?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the use cases that requirement must serve?</p></li>
<li><p>Who will use the specific requirement and for what?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a given requirement fit into the overall system so I know its context?</p></li>
<li><p>How will the product implement the feature that address the given requirement?</p></li>
<li><p>Where in the system architecture should the developers implement the given feature?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I became aware while reading that most of the people for whom this document exists would not have a much better understanding of what needs to be built after reading the document than from before.</p>

<p>During my consideration I listened to a podcast on &quot;<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-10/episode-114-christof-ebert-requirements-engineering">requirements engineering</a>&quot; that interviewed Christof Ebert.</p>

<p>I think the recommendations and principles are valuable regardless of what process is followed -- whether they are done upfront or at the beginning of each iteration with waterfall, agile or a mixture of both.</p>

<p>A few notes from the podcast:</p>

<p><strong>What Requirements Should Define</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What the Customer Needs Are</p></li>
<li><p>What the Product Should Do</p></li>
<li><p>How the Product Should Do It</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common Requirement Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Missing Requirements: Incorrect effort or tactics to seek out (elicit) all of the requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong Requirements: Poor capture, communication or lack of validation with stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing Requirements: Requirements are never static, they always change.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3 Levels of Requirements That Need to be Addressed</strong></p>

<p><em>Market (External)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>what user or client expects</p></li>
<li><p>the &quot;problem space&quot;, defining the problem and what is desired to solve it</p></li>
<li><p>what will make the product successful</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Product (Internal)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>what the product will do</p></li>
<li><p>how the product will address the market requirements</p></li>
<li><p>the &quot;solution space&quot;, defining the solution that will meet the user (market) requirements</p></li>
<li><p>define what functionality and requirements will be made into a product</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Component (Software)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>lower level details of how to implement the requirements in software</p></li>
<li><p>non-functional requirements such as quality, service levels, maintainability etc</p></li>
<li><p>context of requirement in overall system</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is good enough?</strong></p>

<p>Reality must be paid attention to. Generally the economics of a project can not justify the &quot;ivory tower&quot; of solutions for all aspects of a project.</p>

<p>What is good enough to serve the user - in both functional and non-functional requirements?</p>

<p><strong>What is of high priority?</strong></p>

<p>Almost always there is more work to be done than resources, so what is of priority?</p>

<p>What can and will be committed to for development, with what resources and by when?</p>

<p>What can users live without, what must they have?</p>

<p><strong>My Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>As I prepare to attempt a revision of the requirements I&#39;m working on, I must remember the primary reason for the documents existence: to communicate to developers, QA, analysts and business the reason for the product, what value it&#39;s creating and what use cases it will provide functionality for.</p>

<p>If it doesn&#39;t leave the reader with comprehension of what they&#39;ll end up with at the end of development - at least at a 10,000 foot level - and is just a list of features with no context or purpose, then it&#39;s a failure, no matter the length or level of detail.</p>
