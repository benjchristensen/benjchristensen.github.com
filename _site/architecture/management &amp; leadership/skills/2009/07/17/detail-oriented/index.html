  <h1 class="post-title">Detail Oriented</h1>
  <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2009</span>
  <p>I&#39;m working on a fairly significant document that covers the requirements and high-level architecture for a new system based on SOA principles to replace an aging application.</p>

<p>The document is approaching 150 pages and beginning to approach something that properly describes the vision and needs so that business and technical folks can have a solid understanding of scope, requirements, priorities and how it will work (plus general direction on how it will be built).</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort and time to sit down and not only read, but understand the scope of this system. It&#39;s not a simple thing. As much as we try to keep it conceptually simple, there&#39;s a lot going on and a lot of details.</p>

<p>In a few weeks I&#39;m to sit down with a partner team to review and collaborate. My plan was to send over the detailed document for review so we could have a productive meeting to truly discuss missing requirements, strategy, execution planning etc.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve been told they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to read the detailed version -- just a summary -- bullet points with perhaps 10-15 pages.</p>

<p>These are senior developers and architects. Not high level business folks.</p>

<p>Attention to detail is in my opinion an absolute requirement for technical people. Decision making without details is dangerous and fairly useless.</p>

<p>My opinion is not high for people who do not care or have the attention span to be detail oriented.</p>

<p>An executive who&#39;s not directly involved in the operations of something - a summary makes sense.</p>

<p>A team or person who is supposed to directly impact the design and delivery of something and its ongoing operations - if the details aren&#39;t part of their focus, they don&#39;t deserve to be involved.</p>

<p>If they don&#39;t have the time to be detail oriented, then either they shouldn&#39;t be working on the project, their time needs to be re-prioritized, or the project isn&#39;t worth doing.</p>
