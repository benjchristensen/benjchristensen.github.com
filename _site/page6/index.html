    <p>If you&#39;re trying to do a subversion checkout using svn+ssh like this:</p>

<p><code>
svn co svn+ssh://hostname/path
</code></p>

<p>... and are getting a useless error like this ...</p>

<p><code>svn: To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from &#39;ssh&#39; in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file.
svn: Network connection closed unexpectedly</code></p>

<p>Try removing .ssh/known_hosts (which fixed my issue) or ensure that the private/public keys in .ssh have the right permissions, such as this:</p>

<p><code>benjchristensen-notebook:~ benjchristensen$ ls -al .ssh/
drwx------   6 benjchristensen  staff   204 Jun  1 09:30 .
drwxrwxrwx+ 39 benjchristensen  staff  1326 Jun  1 09:24 ..

        My Job Hunt - How I Ended Up At Apple
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2010</span>

    <p>I started working for Apple in their iTunes Store division on December 14th 2009. It&#39;s been a great 6 weeks so far and I look forward to a long and interesting future here at Apple.</p>

<p>Considering the state of the economy and job market I consider myself blessed to have gotten such a great new job - but I worked hard in my hunt and thought it might be of use or interest to others what it took to find a new job.</p>

<p>So, my job hunt &quot;by the numbers&quot; ...</p>

<p><strong>Time on Hunt</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>14 weeks (4 1/2 months)</p></li>
<li><p>August 11th to November 18th</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Job Boards Used</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>7+</p></li>
<li><p>Dice, TheLadder, Monster, Jobirn, Indeed, CyberCoders, SimplyHired</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cost (in money, not time)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$1000+</p></li>
<li><p>$700 on resume</p></li>
<li><p>expenses that weren&#39;t reimbursed during interviews I traveled to</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Friends or Colleagues Notified</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6 (It was a private affair for the first 3/4s of the search)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cities I Looked At</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Virtually anywhere in the US with a big city ....</p></li>
<li><p>In particular I was pursuing cities in the following order...</p>

<ul>
<li>Denver (cause that&#39;s where I lived and own a home)</li>
<li>Austin</li>
<li>Dallas</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
<li>Las Vegas</li>
<li>Southern California</li>
<li>Northern California</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I considered East Coast and that direction (New York, Virginia, DC, Chicago etc) after finding opportunities out there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Jobs Applied or Responded To *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>59 or more not counting the many emails I received and ignored outright</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outright Rejections</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies Who Ignored Me</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>30+ whom I never heard from even after attempted followups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advanced Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source of Leads (for those 6)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>2 - recruiter found my resume on a job board and contacted me</p></li>
<li><p>1 - I responded to a posting on a job board</p></li>
<li><p>2 - I submitted to job postings directly on the company site</p></li>
<li><p>1 - friend referred me to a job at his company after seeing me post on LinkedIn that I was looking (in the last 1/4 of my search when I made it public)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Number of Engineers that Interviewed Me at Those 6 Companies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>30+</p>

<ul>
<li>12 at one company, 10 at another</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flights to Onsite Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>4</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicago</li>
<li>Cupertino</li>
<li>San Francisco</li>
<li>Carlsbad (San Diego County)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Offers Received</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rejections After Advanced Interviews</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it was a great experience. I learned a lot about myself, my worth, what I&#39;m interested in and what opportunities are out there for me.</p>

<p>I had been at Etilize for 7 1/2 years and NEVER gotten a job via a resume before, so this was a significant experience for me to go &quot;out of the blue&quot; searching for a job and get one without having connections before hand.</p>

<p>A few things that I found significant in the process:</p>

<p><strong>1) Get a Professional Resume</strong></p>

<p>Paying for a professional resume writer to redo my resume made a HUGE difference. It made me feel much more confident about sending it off, but I also got much better feedback and callbacks once I began using it. It was completely worth the money and I&#39;d recommend it to anybody serious about their job hunt.</p>

<p>As for the high cost -- don&#39;t go cheap is my opinion. Think about how long it takes to do a good job, the hourly rate you want to be paid and you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s impossible to have a proper job for $150 - which you&#39;ll see advertised. I paid $700 and it was deserved.</p>

<p><strong>2) It Takes Time</strong></p>

<p>Plan for it to take longer than you want or expect. It all takes time.</p>

<p><strong>3) Study</strong></p>

<p>The questions I was asked are things that NEVER get asked or come up in the &quot;real world&quot; and are things I&#39;d typically Google.</p>

<p>Sometimes that&#39;s a valid answer ... &quot;I&#39;d Google that&quot; ... but it won&#39;t get you far on most interviews.</p>

<p>I had to dust off my understanding on a lot of computer science theory, algorithms, data structures, and other such things. In fact, the one major set of interviews I went through and ultimately got rejected from was the first series I went through and I believe 3 things caused the rejection (not my lack of skill):</p>

<p>a) questions about things I hadn&#39;t studied (and studied thereafter and was prepared for in subsequent interviews)</p>

<p>b) I was over-dressed ... a suit and tie for an engineering position set the wrong tone</p>

<p>c) I was not myself and stressed (this was more to do with the fact that it was my first real interviews in a decade ... ok, ever...)</p>

<p>It was really frustrating at times and absolutely exhilarating at others ... a real roller-coaster all the way through. By the end though I had a better sense of value and who I am and an exciting new career path.</p>

<p>Good luck to anyone else reading this and doing their own search!</p>

        Technical Debt Quadrant

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2009</span>

    <p>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">wrote a blog entry</a> on technical debt this week that communicates the concepts of &quot;technical debt&quot; and classifies them very well.</p>

<p><a href="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/techdebtquadrant.png"><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/techdebtquadrant.png" alt="techDebtQuadrant"></a></p>

<p>Some favorite portions:</p>

<blockquote>"A mess is a reckless debt which results in crippling interest payments or a long period of paying down the principal."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prudent debt to reach a release may not be worth paying down if the interest payments are sufficiently small - such as if it were in a rarely touched part of the code-base."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not just is there a difference between prudent and reckless debt, there's also a difference between deliberate and inadvertent debt. The prudent debt example is deliberate because the team knows they are taking on a debt, and thus puts some thought as to whether the payoff for an earlier release is greater than the costs of paying it off. A team ignorant of design practices is taking on its reckless debt without even realizing how much hock it's getting into."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"while you're programming, you are learning. It's often the case that it can take a year of programming on a project before you understand what the best design approach should have been. Perhaps one should plan projects to spend a year building a system that you throw away and rebuild, but that's a tricky plan to sell. Instead what you find is that the moment you realize what the design should have been, you also realize that you have an inadvertent debt."</blockquote>

    <p>Following are some good posts with further evidence of the impact of webpage/webapp responsiveness to the user experience, amount of usage and ultimately revenue.</p>

<p>Good introductory quote to the external links and images shown below:</p>

<blockquote>There’s no longer any debate. There’s reliable, reproducible evidence that web page latency is directly tied to the bottom line. At Velocity, Microsoft, Google and Shopzilla made this abundantly clear in a series of awesome presentations: detailed, controlled testing proves that slower pages hurt the bottom line. In Google’s case, adding delay reduces the average number of searches a visitor does each day even after the delay is removed.</blockquote>

<p>Regarding &quot;smaller scale&quot; sites more typical than Google and Bing:</p>

<blockquote>The results of their analysis show how significant a reduction in page latency can be. In addition to reducing bounce rates, and increasing pages per visit & time on site, t**hey found a 16.07% increase in conversion rates and a 5.50% increase in average order value.** - [http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/watching-websites.html](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/watching-websites.html)</blockquote>

        Mac OSX 10.6 Java - java.io.tmpdir
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>Migrating from OSX 10.5 to Snow Leopard, 10.6 caused all of my java projects using embedded MySQL MXJ to fail.</p>

<p>I found that this was because Java returns a very odd path for the &quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot; property:</p>

<p><em>/private/var/folders/b4/b44x97M0GFydt3jCKcowsU+++TI/-Tmp-/</em></p>

<p>This causes issues with MySQL MXJ as it converts the + signs into spaces so the path becomes:</p>

<p><em>/private/var/folders/b4/b44x97M0GFydt3jCKcowsU TI/-Tmp-/</em></p>

<p>The original code was:</p>

<p>private static File tmpDir = new File(System.getProperty(&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;));</p>

<p>To fix it I put in the following hack so that MySQL MXJ will now work again and I can still use the &quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot; property on other systems such as Windows:</p>

<p>private static File ourAppDir;</p>

<p>static {
String tempPath = System.getProperty(&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;);
// a fix to handle the crazy path the Mac JVM returns
if (tempPath.startsWith(&quot;/var/folders/&quot;)) tempPath = &quot;/tmp/&quot;;
ourAppDir = new File(tempPath);
}</p>
