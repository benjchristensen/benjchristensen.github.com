        Dynamic Directory of Jar Files in Classpath via Eclipse Plugin
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 May 2011</span>

    <p>I came across a scenario where I needed Eclipse to dynamically add a folder of jar files to the classpath and found out that Eclipse doesn&#39;t support this out of the box (no idea why ... IntelliJ does).</p>

<p>So I began Googling and found &quot;how&quot; to solve it by writing a classpath container but could find a pre-packaged solution.</p>

<p>The how was explained here: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-eclipse-classpath/">https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-eclipse-classpath/</a></p>

<p>I took that example and tweaked it into a working plugin. It now lives at <a href="https://github.com/benjchristensen/SimpleDirectoryContainer_EclipsePlugin">GitHub</a> where the plugin and source can be downloaded.</p>

<p>Once the plugin is installed in Eclipse, edit the &quot;Java Build Path&quot; on a project and click &quot;Add Library&quot; and choose &quot;Directory Container&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/add-library.png"><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/add-library.png?w=800" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Then choose the folder (a subfolder of the project so it&#39;s relative) and defines what file extensions it should include:</p>

<p><a href="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/creating-library.png"><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/creating-library.png?w=800" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Once saved this library will show up like any other Eclipse classpath library and show all Jar files from the selected folder ... and most importantly will dynamically update the classpath when refreshed to whatever is in that folder.

<p>I hope this helps someone else needing the same behavior in Eclipse!</p>

    <p>This week I started a new job at Netflix as a Senior Software Engineer on their API Platform team to work on this: http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/02/redesigning-netflix-api.html.</p>

<p>Hence, the silence while I&#39;ve worked at Apple is somewhat lifted so I may get back to writing on my blog more often - particularly about technical things.</p>

        3 Signs of a Miserable Job
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2010</span>

    <p>I read &quot;3 Signs of a Miserable Job&quot; and found it to have some good insights into jobs, career and particularly management. It&#39;s an easy read, most of the book in the form of a fable, readable in an evening or two. </p>

<p>It can be found on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job-ebook/dp/B000UZQHD4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">Kindle</a> or <a href="http://ax.itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-three-signs-miserable/id381153191#ls=1">iBooks</a>. </p>

<p>Below are some screen-captures of passages I liked (<a href="https://twitter.com/benjchristensen/status/27656848696">sorry for the images as opposed to text</a>):</p>

<p>Summary of the &quot;3 Signs&quot;</p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/20101017-083638.jpg?w=800" alt="3 signs of a miserable job"></p>

<p>The book makes it clear that it doesn&#39;t matter what the job is nor does higher compensation ultimately negate the need of these things. </p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/20101017-083652.jpg?w=800" alt="What a miserable job is"></p>

<p>In the end, the manager is the person who has the biggest impact on a persons happiness in their job and the case is made as to the importance of a manager in the life of those he manages yet how most managers don&#39;t realize this nor act on it - hence the misery of many in what would otherwise be fulfilling and satisfying jobs.</p>

<p>For me &quot;immeasurement&quot; is the one that hits closest to home as being something that affects me in my day to day life and that I&#39;ve done poorly when I&#39;ve managed others. </p>

<p><img src="http://benjchristensen.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/20101017-083704.jpg?w=800" alt="immeasurement"></p>

<p>Software development (where I personally have experience and can apply these lessons) in general is difficult in this regard - projects and code are never really done. Sure, something is deployed or ships, but then it&#39;s on to fixing things, adding the next feature or whatever, and rarely does an individual person have full impact on a product or system such that they can measure their success with it, especially on large teams or products. </p>

<p>Timelines or task completion are impossible to use as yardsticks as they vary wildly and change all the time - the very definition of &quot;moving goalposts&quot;. Don&#39;t even get me started on &quot;lines of code&quot; - the worst possible form of measurement. Bugs (or lack thereof) don&#39;t work either for many reasons that I won&#39;t get into here. </p>

<p>I have yet to see an objective way of measuring software development that works - any ideas?</p>

        Leadership, Solitude and Thinking
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2010</span>

    <p>These are quotes that I liked on the subject of leadership from the following article which I recommend taking the time to read and think about. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/">Solitude and Leadership: an article by William Deresiewicz | The American Scholar</a></p>

<blockquote>
"solitude is one of the most important necessities of true leadership"

"what I saw around me were great kids who had been trained to be world-class hoop jumpers. Any goal you set them, they could achieve. Any test you gave them, they could pass with flying colors. They were, as one of them put it herself, 'excellent sheep.'"

"excellence isn’t usually what gets you up the greasy pole. What gets you up is a talent for maneuvering. ... Not taking stupid risks like trying to change how things are done or question why they’re done. Just keeping the routine going."

"We have a crisis of leadership in this country, in every institution."

"We have a crisis of leadership in America because our overwhelming power and wealth, earned under earlier generations of leaders, made us complacent, and for too long we have been training leaders who only know how to keep the routine going. Who can answer questions, but don’t know how to ask them. Who can fulfill goals, but don’t know how to set them. Who think about how to get things done, but not whether they’re worth doing in the first place. What we have now are the greatest technocrats the world has ever seen, people who have been trained to be incredibly good at one specific thing, but who have no interest in anything beyond their area of exper tise. What we don’t have are leaders.

What we don’t have, in other words, are thinkers. People who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for the country, for a corporation or a college, for the Army—a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision."

"there are a lot of highly educated people who don’t know how to think at all."

"what makes him [General David Petraeus] a thinker—and a leader—is precisely that he is able to think things through for himself. And because he can, he has the confidence, the courage, to argue for his ideas even when they aren’t popular."

"true leadership means being able to think for yourself and act on your convictions"

"people do not multitask effectively. And here’s the really surprising finding: the more people multitask, the worse they are, not just at other mental abilities, but at multitasking itself."

"Multitasking, in short, is not only not thinking, it impairs your ability to think."

"You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating."

"Leadership means finding a new direction, not simply putting yourself at the front of the herd that’s heading toward the cliff."

"Once the situation is upon you, it’s too late. You have to be prepared in advance. You need to know, already, who you are and what you believe: not what the Army believes, not what your peers believe (that may be exactly the problem), but what you believe. How can you know that unless you’ve taken counsel with yourself in solitude?"

        Trigger Native Javascript Events with Prototype.js
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2010</span>

    <p>After much searching and playing with various solutions, I found one at this page:</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/590289/javascript-event-that-fires-without-user-interaction/590339#590339</p>

<p>This provides an easy method for programmatically invoking native events such as &quot;onchange&quot;.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;true&quot; wraplines=&quot;true&quot;]</p>

<p>// this supports trigger native events such as &#39;onchange&#39; 
// whereas prototype.js Event.fire only supports custom events
function triggerEvent(element, eventName) {
    // safari, webkit, gecko
    if (document.createEvent)
    {
    var evt = document.createEvent(&#39;HTMLEvents&#39;);
    evt.initEvent(eventName, true, true);</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    return element.dispatchEvent(evt);
}

// Internet Explorer
if (element.fireEvent) {
    return element.fireEvent(&#39;on&#39; + eventName);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>}</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>This is primarily to deal with prototype.js not allowing the firing of native events (which jQuery does).</p>

<p>Here is another approach I found but have not tried which adds the capability to prototype.js: <a href="http://github.com/kangax/protolicious/blob/5b56fdafcd7d7662c9d648534225039b2e78e371/event.simulate.js">event.simulate.js</a></p>
